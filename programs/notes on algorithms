I don't even really know how to approach learning algorithms. The right way is not just going to come from passively sitting an doing nothing. Everything takes action and I need to be prepared for it. Stop trying to think about what is going to happen in the future and trying to pass time. The best way to learn is to really take it all in, and really enjoy.
